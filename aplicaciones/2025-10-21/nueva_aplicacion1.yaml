  - Contribute to data-driven solutions for onboarding, segmentation, matching, pricing, and more.

  - Experience designing and analyzing A/B tests with statistical rigor
  - Knowledge of Python or R for ad-hoc analysis or advanced data manipulation
  - Solid grasp of applied statistics: hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, significance thresholds
