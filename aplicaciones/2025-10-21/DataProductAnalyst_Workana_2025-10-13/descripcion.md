## Descripción

The mission of this role is to act as the analytical partner for the Product team leading the company's marketplace. 
This includes supporting both growth initiatives and the development of key modules within our ecosystem. A strong data perspective will be essential to enable a continuous cycle of discovery, experimentation, validation, and iteration. This is not about answering questions — it's about helping the team ask better ones, faster. 
This is not a support or traditional reporting role. It's a hands-on, impact-oriented role, focused on building solutions together with the product team.
