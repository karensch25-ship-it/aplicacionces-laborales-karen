  As a Product Data Specialist, you'll be directly impacting our results through insights and reports. You'll be working close to product managers, researchers, and other business stakeholders, helping with prioritization, assessments, and business recommendations. 
  It will be your responsibility, alongside the Analytics team, to nurture the data-driven culture within the company, making data easier to consume, be it through interactive reports, easy-to-use datasets, documentation, training.

requerimientos:
- Modeling & Analysis. A marketplace is a complex system, with various moving parts and often contradicting signals. That creates an extremely exciting pool of opportunities to find gaps, insights, or optimizations. The analysis and models we need have different degrees of complexity, from simple AB tests to multivariate models on retention or ETA. We expect you to have advanced experience in SQL and intermediate experience in Python or R
- Reporting. If a complex system creates an exciting pool of opportunities, it also creates a high number of metrics that we need to keep track of to run the business efficiently. However, a dashboard is only as good as our trust in being correct and updated. It's your responsibility to understand the needs of the teams you'll be working with and help the Analytics team create and maintain our reporting system, keeping it organized and user-friendly. For that, you'll be mainly using Tableau and Metabase
- Analytics Engineering. Although it wont be your main focus, occasionally, you will need to work on the inner layers of our Data Warehouse to provide clean and documented datasets to empower our reports and end users within the organization. Understanding the business needs and consolidating them into our DW is crucial to maintaining a reliable single source of truth. We use DBT for the data transformation, so SQL experience is a must
- Experience. You have 4+ years of experience in data & analytics at data-driven companies
- Education. You have a STEM or business background or relevant education that makes you suited to empower our organization to be more data-driven
- Learning Mindset. You take pride in understanding problems deeply and asking the right questions. You can absorb a variety of topics with extreme ease, having a structured and logical approach to developing your understanding of the business and its challenges. This is unlikely to be a good fit if you have a preconceived system of processes and methods and plan on just applying them without first learning all the ways our business is unique
- Team player. You are ready to work alongside exceptional people, helping them achieve great results. You create an environment where people are excited to work with you daily, with intellectual honesty and trust
- Business focus. You care deeply about understanding business needs and how your analysis connects with our product, customers, and financials. You can envision how metrics drill down from the highest to the lowest level, identifying what needs to be analyzed or reported on each
- Bias for action. You understand that despite your careful approach to understanding problems and identifying opportunities, you actively try to avoid being a perfectionist or getting yourself tied up in knots. You have a bias for action in order to make progress. You enjoy being scrappy and constraints enthrall you. This is unlikely to be a good fit if you, by default, like building full solutions from the get-go
